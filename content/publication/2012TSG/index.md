abstract = "The problem of modeling and stochastic optimization for home energy management is considered. Several different types of load classes are discussed, including heating, ventilation, and air conditioning unit, plug-in hybrid electric vehicle, and deferrable loads such as washer and dryer. A first-order thermal dynamic model is extracted and validated using real measurements collected over an eight months time span. A mixed integer multi-time scale stochastic optimization is formulated for the scheduling of loads of different characteristics. A model predictive control based heuristic is proposed. Numerical simulations coupled with real data measurements are used for performance evaluation and comparison studies."
