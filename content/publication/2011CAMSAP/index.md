# Abstract and optional shortened version.
abstract = "The problem of scheduling and control of appliances for Home Energy Management (HEM) is considered. A multi-time scale and multi-stage stochastic optimization framework is proposed for the control of the Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) unit, the charging of Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicle (PHEV), and the scheduling of deferrable load such as washer/dryer operations. Formulated as a constrained stochastic optimization that incorporates thermal dynamics, temperature measurements, and the real time pricing signal, a model predictive control algorithm is proposed that minimizes customer's discomfort level subject to cost and peak power constraints."
