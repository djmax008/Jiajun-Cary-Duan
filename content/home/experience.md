•	Developed an adaptive microgrid management systems. The secondary and primary controllers are designed in a decentralized way to realize proper load sharing and plug-and-play functions with unknown system parameters. The proposed control can guarantee that the desired generation references of tertiary control can be accurately achieved.
•	Reduced the overshoot of transient voltage/current up to 30% for AC/DC microgrids with inverter-interfaced DGs based on advanced control designs. Performed the switch-level real time simulation using RT-Lab.
•	Resolved the impact of pulsed power load in the shipboard power system by introducing and applying the Zero-Sum Game Theory. Accomplished the demonstration with both real time simulation and hardware-in-the-loop experiments.
•	Achieved optimal control of parallel uninterruptible power supply (UPS) system by designing a Neuro Network algorithm to train the unknown system dynamics.
